# Pictures of the Wireless Water Tamk Sensor.
This folder contains pictures of the assembly of the project with 2 Arduino Nano, 2 HC-12 modules and JSN-SR04T.
## Attention:
These pictures only show an *early non-working setup* (problem in HC-12).
They are kept here to:
- Document the initial build and testing process
- Highlight wiring mistakes
- Keep a record before corrections
## The following images show:
- Connection of the JSN-SR04T sensor to the Arduino Nano
- Wiring of the HC-12 module (The problem might be here)
- LEDs and Buzzer as indicators
- potentiometer to declare the height of the tank

## Remider:
A corrected version of the assembly with updated wiring and explanations will be added later.
